# pwn-exercises
My exploits, write-ups and notes that I've been using while learning things related to pwn.

I solved protostar challenges in the past. However, it was more like a blackbox approach by finding the right offset and playing around with debuggers. This time, I tried a bit harder in order to read asm more to calculate the offset and understanding more as you could see.

You might be interested in the solution of the Protostar Stack-5, I did not see a similar answer to mine yet. Enjoy.
